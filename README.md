DesignOps tool for my organization, AKUR8.  Index Panel is a Figma widget that auto-generates an index of your Figma frames to make large projects easy to navigate for devs, PMs, and designers.

It's a smart index that includes frame names, figma hyperlinks, JIRA links, and an easy-to-update status column.

Thank you Lovefields for making the original widget <3
